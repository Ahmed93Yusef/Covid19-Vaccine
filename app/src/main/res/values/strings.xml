    <string name="Why_should_I_get_vaccinated">Without vaccines, we are at risk of serious illness and disability from diseases like measles, meningitis, pneumonia, tetanus and polio. Many of these diseases can be life-threatening. WHO estimates that childhood vaccines alone save over 4 million lives every year.Although some diseases may have become uncommon, the germs that cause them continue to circulate in some or all parts of the world. In today‚Äôs world, infectious diseases can easily cross borders, and infect anyone who is not protectedTwo key reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. Because not everyone can be vaccinated ‚Äì including very young babies, those who are seriously ill or have certain allergies ‚Äì they depend on others being vaccinated to ensure they are also safe from vaccine-preventable diseases.</string>
    <string name="How_does_a_vaccine_work">Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body‚Äôs natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:Recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria.Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.Remembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick.</string>
    <string name="Are_vaccines_safe">Vaccination is safe and side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare.Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it is introduced. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause health risks.Remember, you are far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine. For example, tetanus can cause extreme pain, muscle spasms (lockjaw) and blood clots, measles can cause encephalitis (an infection of the brain) and blindness. Many vaccine-preventable diseases can even result in death. The benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the risks, and many more illnesses and deaths would occur without vaccines.</string>
